# Learn Engineering Docs

## Learning Goals

- Explain the complexity of a production application

## Introduction

You've seen parts of the Flatiron technical platform from the student and teacher side. Reading more about it from the Engineering perspective will give you a sense of the complexity of the code that supports the application.

## Pre-check

- Do a rough sketch of your current idea of the learn system. What are the key features? What are the major systems? How do they connect together?
- What languages do you think make up learn's tech stack? How many classes? How many repos?

## Instructions

Read the Flatiron Engineering Team's docs about [the major systems that make up the learn platform](https://docs.learn.co/operations/learnco/). Browse the pages underneath that heading with sketches of the most important subsystems of learn.

## Post-check

- How up to date do you think these docs are? How much would you guess is missing?
- Revise your sketch of the learn system. What were some of the main pieces that your original sketch was missing?
- Set up a coffee chat with someone on the tech team. Some topics of conversation might be a) things they've learned since joining the tech team, b) what they're working on now, c) what's challenging about working on a large system like learn
